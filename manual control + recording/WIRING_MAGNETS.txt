WIRING GUIDE: ARM + DUAL ELECTROMAGNETS
===========================================================

IMPORTANT: The previous firmware used pins 22 & 23 for servos.
Because the magnet example code also used 22 & 23, we had a conflict.
I have ASSIGNED NEW PINS for the magnets in the new firmware.

1. UPLOAD FIRMWARE FIRST
------------------------
Before wiring the magnets, upload the new code:
`manual control + recording/firmware_with_magnets/controlled_arm_with_magnets.ino`
to your ESP32.

2. SERVO WIRING (UNCHANGED)
---------------------------
Leave your servos exactly as they are:
- Servo 1: GPIO 13
- Servo 2: GPIO 14
- Servo 3: GPIO 22
- Servo 4: GPIO 23
- Servo 5: GPIO 21

3. MAGNET WIRING (NEW PINS)
---------------------------
You will need your Relay Module.

A. CONNECT RELAY TO ESP32
   | RELAY PIN | ESP32 PIN | FUNCTION |
   |-----------|-----------|----------|
   | GND       | GND       | Common Ground |
   | IN1       | GPIO 19   | Magnet 1 (Top) Control |
   | IN2       | GPIO 16   | Magnet 2 (Side) Control |
   | VCC       | 5V (Ext)  | Power for Relay Optocouplers |

B. CONNECT MAGNETS TO RELAY
   (Follow the same logic as the original magnet documentation)
   - External Power (+) -> Relay COM
   - Relay NO (Normally Open) -> Magnet (+)
   - Magnet (-) -> External Power (-)

C. LE DEUXIEME GND DU RELAY MODULE AU GROUND DE L'ALIM EXTERNE 5V.


4. TESTING
----------
After uploading and wiring:
1. Open the Manual Controller GUI.
2. You will see two new buttons "Magnet 1" and "Magnet 2".
3. Clicking them should click the relays and toggle the magnets.
