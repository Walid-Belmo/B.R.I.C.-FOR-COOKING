NEXT STEPS FOR PRECISE ROBOT CONTROL
====================================

PHASE 1: PHYSICAL MEASUREMENTS (THE "PAPER" MODEL)
--------------------------------------------------
Goal: Replace "magic numbers" in code with real physical dimensions.
Based on your description, we need the 3D distance between each joint's center of rotation.
Please provide the following (in mm), keeping the robot in its "Zero" pose (e.g., straight up):

1. **Origin (Base) to Shoulder (Servo 2) [Frame 1 -> 2]**
   - [ ] Delta Z: Vertical height from table to Servo 2 axis.
   - [ ] Delta Y: Horizontal sideways distance from Servo 1 axis to Servo 2 axis.
   - [ ] Delta X: Forward/Back distance (if S2 is pushed forward relative to S1 center).

2. **Shoulder to Elbow (Servo 2 -> 3) [Frame 2 -> 3]**
   - [ ] Delta Z: Vertical distance between S2 axis and S3 axis.
   - [ ] Delta X/Y: Any sideways/forward offsets (You mentioned "only vertically", so these might be 0).
   
3. **Elbow to Wrist (Servo 3 -> 4) [Frame 3 -> 4]**
   - [ ] Delta X: Forward distance.
   - [ ] Delta Y: Sideways distance.
   - [ ] Delta Z: Vertical distance.
   
4. **Wrist to Tool Tip (Servo 4 -> Tip) [Frame 4 -> Tip]**
   - [ ] Delta X: Forward offset of tip.
   - [ ] Delta Y: Sideways offset of tip.
   - [ ] Delta Z: Vertical length of tool.

PHASE 2: ANGLE CALIBRATION (STEP-BY-STEP)
-----------------------------------------
Goal: Ensure that when code thinks "90 degrees", the robot actually moves 90 degrees.
Action Items:
1. **Define "Zero" Pose**: Decide what the robot looks like when all angles are 0.
   - Proposal: Straight up vertical candle ( | ).
2. **Calibrate Servo 1 (Base - TD-8120MG 270°)**:
   - Note: Since these are 270° servos, standard library defaults (180°) will be WRONG.
   - We must find the correct `DEG_PER_US` factor. Expected approx `270 / 2000 = 0.135` deg/us.
   - Command it to move +90 then -90. Measure with protractor.
3. **Calibrate Servos 2 & 3 (TD-8120MG 270°)**:
   - Repeat the process.
   - **TRIM**: Since you said neutral (1500) is "roughly vertical but not perfect", we will use the `TRIM` value in Python to mathematically make 0° = Perfect Vertical.


PHASE 3: KINEMATICS IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON)
-------------------------------------------
Goal: Update the math model with Phase 1 & 2 data.
Action Items:
1. Create `kinematics_config.py` to store the new constants.
2. Update `driver_gui.py` to use a cleaner Vector or Matrix calculation (less error-prone than raw trig).
3. Verify: Move robot to specific X,Y,Z predicted by Python and measure with ruler.

PHASE 4: INVERSE KINEMATICS (IK)
--------------------------------
Goal: Tell the robot "Go to X=100, Y=0, Z=50" and let it calculate angles.
Action Items:
1. Implement analytic or geometric IK solver in Python.
2. Add "Go to Coordinate" fields in the GUI.

PHASE 5: AUTOMATION
-------------------
Goal: Cooking Sequence.
1. Record a sequence of X,Y,Z points.
2. Replay them to stir/pick up items.
