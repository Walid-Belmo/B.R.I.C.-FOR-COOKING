FAILURE REPORT - MECHANISM INTEGRITY COMPROMISED
Date: January 7, 2026
Module: Inverse Kinematics / Mechanical Drive
===================================================================

INCIDENT DESCRIPTION:
During the initial testing of the Numerical Inverse Kinematics (IK) solver, 
the robot was commanded to a coordinate that was physically unreachable or 
blocked by an obstacle.

ROOT CAUSE:
1. Open Loop System: The software has no feedback from the servos. It sent 
   a position command (pulse width), assumed the servo reached it, and 
   continued calculations based on that assumption.
2. Mechanical Overload: The servo (likely J2, the main shoulder joint) 
   encountered excessive resistance. The high torque of the metal-gear servo 
   overpowered the plastic splines of the servo horn/arm connection.

DAMAGE ASSESSMENT:
- The plastic spline (teeth) inside the servo horn has stripped. 
- RESULT: The arm now slips. The physical angle of the arm no longer matches 
  the servo's internal potentiometer.
- WARNING: The arm may appear to move under light load, but will fail/slip 
  under normal operation.

IMPACT ON SOFTWARE CONFIGURATION:
- The 'zero' positions (Calibration) are now INVALID.
- The 'Trims' defined in kinematics_config.py are now INVALID.
- Any existing saved poses are likely DANGEROUS to run until fixed.

REQUIRED ACTIONS:
1. HARDWARE: Replace the stripped plastic servo horn with a METAL horn 
   (e.g., Aluminium 25T).
2. ASSEMBLY: Re-seat the arm onto the servo while the software is sending 
   the '1500us// filepath: c:\Users\iceoc\Documents\cooker_mini_bras\Inverse_Kinematic_Implementation\FAILURE_REPORT.txt
