FORWARD KINEMATICS ACCURACY REPORT
====================================
Date: January 7, 2026
Method: Manual Verification (Physical vs Calculated)

SUMMARY
-------
The Forward Kinematics (FK) model is considered VALID for the current project requirements.
Geometric offsets, servo scaling factors, and directions have been calibrated.

ACCURACY METRICS
----------------
1. Z-Axis (Vertical Height):
   - Precision: High
   - Estimated Error: ±1 mm to ±3 mm (Max)
   - Notes: Demonstrated consistent accuracy during vertical and horizontal arm tests.

2. X/Y-Axis (Planar Reach):
   - Precision: Good
   - Estimated Error: ±2 mm to ±5 mm (Max)
   - Notes: "Worst case" scenario (full extension or complex compound angles) yields ~5mm deviation. Typical usage sees ~2-3mm deviation.

CONTRIBUTING FACTORS
--------------------
- Servo 4 (Wrist) Scale Factor: Corrected from 0.135 to 0.09 (MG90S).
- Joint Offsets: Calibrated manually via GUI.
- Mechanical Slop: Base wobble contributes to X/Y error at full extension.
