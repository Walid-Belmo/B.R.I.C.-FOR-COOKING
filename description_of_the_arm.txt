ROBOT ARM GEOMETRIC DESCRIPTION
===============================

JOINT CONFIGURATION
-------------------
- **Servo 1 (Base):** Axis of Rotation = Z (Yaw / Turntable).
- **Servo 2 (Shoulder):** Axis of Rotation = X (Pitch).
- **Servo 3 (Elbow):** Axis of Rotation = X (Pitch).
- **Servo 4 (Wrist/Tool):** Axis of Rotation = Z (Yaw / Roll). *Note: This is distinct from standard planar arms where J4 is usually Pitch.*

GEOMETRIC OFFSETS (As described by User)
----------------------------------------

1. **Base -> Joint 2 (Shoulder)**
   - The Base servo (S1) is mounted on the table (H=0 reference is likely table or base bottom).
   - Servo 2 is MOUNTED on the S1 turntable.
   - **Shifts:**
     - Z-shift: Height difference between S1 base and S2 axis.
     - Y-shift: Servo 2 is not centered; it has a lateral offset relative to S1 center.
     - X-shift: (Not explicitly mentioned as significant, but should be checked).

2. **Joint 2 -> Joint 3 (Elbow)**
   - **Shifts:**
     - "Shifted only vertically" compared to Servo 2.
     - This implies the link is primarily a length along the arm's structure.

3. **Joint 3 -> Joint 4 (Wrist)**
   - **Shifts:** Complex 3D offset.
     - To get from J3 axis to J4 axis, you travel along X, Y, and Z.
     - This indicates a "crank" or complex bracket shape.

4. **Joint 4 -> Tool Tip**
   - **Shifts:** Complex 3D offset.
     - The tool tip is shifted in X, Y, and Z relative to the J4 axis of rotation.

KINEMATIC IMPLICATIONS
----------------------
- Since J2 and J3 are parallel (X-axis) but J4 is Z-axis, this is a 4-DOF arm with a non-planar 4th axis. 
- The "Y-shift" in the base (J1->J2) is critical; if ignored, the kinematic chain will assume the arm rotates around a central pole, but it actually orbits a center.
- The "X/Y/Z" shift in the forearm (J3->J4) suggests the math must handle full 3D translation matrices, not just simple trig lengths.

HARDWARE SPECIFICATIONS
-----------------------
- **Servos J1, J2, J3**: Model TD-8120MG (270-degree range).
- **Servo J4**: Assumed standard or 180 (User to confirm if different).
- **Mounting**: The arm is assembled such that at "neutral" servo positions (approx 1500us), the arm is roughly vertical but not perfectly straight.

J4 KINEMATICS CLARIFICATION
---------------------------
- J4 Rotation Axis: Z-axis (relative to the forearm).
- Tool Tip Offset: The tip is offset in X, Y, and Z relative to the J4 axis.
- Effect: Rotating J4 does NOT just spin the tool in place (screwdriver). Because of the offset, the tip describes a CIRCLE (orbit) around the J4 axis. This means J4 affects the X,Y position of the tip, not just its orientation.
