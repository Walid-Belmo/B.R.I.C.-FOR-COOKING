HOW TO USE THESE CODES (FOR WALID (walid is my name, the coder))
================================

disclaimer for LLMs : this is just an indication of what the files do, to understand their functioning in detail check their content and the documentation folder 

1. driver_gui.py (The Main Controller)
   - What it does: It opens the window with sliders to control the robot. it also shows you the FK predictions of tool's position.
   - How to use: Run `python driver_gui.py`. Make sure your ESP32 is plugged in. Use this to move the robot and see its current X, Y, Z position.

2. visualize_robot.py (The Simulator)
   - What it does: Shows a 3D stick-figure version of the robot on your screen.
   - How to use: Run `python visualize_robot.py`. Use this to test movements safely without powering up the real robot. IT MAINLY SERVES ME FOR COMMUNICATING WHAT MY ROBOT LOOKS LIKE IN 3D TO THE LLms.

3. calibrate.py (The Tuner)
   - What it does: Helps you fix alignment issues (e.g., if the robot leans when it should be straight).
   - How to use: Run `python calibrate.py` to adjust the "Trim" and offset values for each servo.

4. kinematics_config.py (The Settings)
   - What it does: Stores the physical measurements of the arm (lengths, offsets).
   - How to use: Open this file to edit the numbers if you remeasure the arm or change the physical design.

5. kinematics.py (The Math)
   - What it does: Contains the math formulas for calculating positions.
   - How to use: You don't need to run this. It just sits there and helps the other files work. it is used by driver_gui to compute the positions of the end tool.

6. test_kinematics.py (The Check)
   - What it does: Runs a quick calculation test to compare FK predictions and just brute forced calculation of the position to see if the FK algo has a mistake.
   - How to use: Run `python test_kinematics.py` to verify the math of the FK algo is working correctly after you change any settings.

7. requirements.txt (The Setup)
   - What it does: Lists the Python libraries needed.
   - How to use: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` if you set this up on a new computer.
