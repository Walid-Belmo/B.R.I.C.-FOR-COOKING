FORWARD KINEMATICS V6 - PYTHON MATRIX IMPLEMENTATION
======================================================
Architecture Change:
- Moved all complex math from ESP32 (C++) to PC (Python).
- ESP32 is now just a dummy driver (receives "s1-1500", writes PWM).
- PC handles all Inverse/Forward Kinematics.

Improvements:
1. Matrix-Based Math:
   - Uses Homogeneous Transformation Matrices (4x4) via NumPy.
   - Accurately handles 3D compound rotations and offsets.
   - Handles the critical "Wrist Orbit" (J4 offset from J3) correctly which was impossible with simple trigonometry.

2. Precise Measurements (from CAD):
   - All "magic numbers" replaced with measured values from PrusaSlicer.
   - Defined in 'kinematics_config.py'.
   - SERVO_SCALE corrected: 270 degrees range confirmed (0.135 deg/us).

3. File Structure:
   - PYTHON_CONTROL/
     |-- driver_gui.py        : Main application.
     |-- kinematics.py        : Math engine (Forward Kinematics).
     |-- kinematics_config.py : Configuration & Measurements.

4. Usage:
   - Run `python driver_gui.py`.
   - Connect to ESP32 Serial Port.
   - Sliders now drive the arm AND update the X,Y,Z display in real-time.
   - Use the "Trim" boxes to zero out mechanical alignment errors.

5. Calibration Procedure:
   - Set all servos to 1500 (Visual center).
   - Measure actual angles.
   - Enter offsets in "Trim" box until physical arm matches "model" (Visual vertical/horizontal).
   - Use 'kinematics_config.py' to permanently save offsets if needed.
