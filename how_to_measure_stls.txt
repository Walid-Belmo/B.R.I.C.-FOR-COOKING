GUIDE: HOW TO MEASURE ROBOT DIMENSIONS FROM STLs (High Precision)
================================================================

Since 3D prints can warp and calipers are hard to use on assembled robots, extracting dimensions from the source STL files is the "Gold Standard" for accuracy.

Even though you only have meshes (STLs), you CAN use Fusion 360 (Free Personal Version) to find the exact centers of rotation.

PRECISE METHOD: Fusion 360 "Mesh Section"
-----------------------------------------
This method allows you to "slice" the STL and turn the servo holes into 2D sketch circles, giving you the EXACT center point coordinates.

1. **Import the STL**:
   - Open Fusion 360.
   - Go to `Insert` > `Insert Mesh`. Select your STL file.
   - Click OK.

2. **Create a Slice**:
   - Go to the `Mesh` tab (top menu).
   - Select `Create` > `Create Mesh Section Sketch`.
   - Click on the Mesh body.
   - Select a Plane (Top, Front, or Right) that cuts through the holes you want to measure (e.g., the servo mounting hole and the next pivot hole).
   - You can drag the arrow to move the slice up/down until it clearly cuts through both circles.
   - Click OK. This creates a new Sketch.

3. **Find the Centers**:
   - Open the content browser on the left, find the new Sketch (under "Sketches"), right-click it and `Edit Sketch`.
   - The hole walls are now lines.
   - Press `C` (Circle Tool). Choose "3-Point Circle" (or `Create` > `Circle` > `3-Point Circle`).
   - Click on 3 points around the rough edge of the servo hole curve.
   - Fusion will draw a perfect circle and mark the CENTER point.
   - Repeat for the other pivot hole.

4. **Measure**:
   - Press `I` (Inspect/Measure).
   - Click the Center Point of the first circle.
   - Click the Center Point of the second circle.
   - Fusion will show:
     - **Distance**: The direct line length.
     - **dX, dY, dZ**: The precise offsets (Check the "XYZ Delta" checkbox if needed).

ALTERNATIVE: PrusaSlicer (Good, but less precise)
-------------------------------------------------
If you cannot use Fusion 360, PrusaSlicer has a basic measurement tool.

1. Load the STL.
2. Use the **Measure** tool (ruler icon on the left, shortcut `M`).
3. It tries to snap to vertices (corners of triangles), but STLs are made of triangles, so there is no vertex exactly in the center of a circle.
   - **Workaround**: 
     - Click two points on opposite sides of the hole diameter. Note the distance. Calculate the mid-point? (Risky).
     - **Better**: Use the "Coordinates" feature. 
       - Orient the part so the hole is flat on the bed.
       - Look for the bounding box center? (Only works if the part is symmetric).

**CONCLUSION:**
Use the Fusion 360 "Mesh Section" method. It guarantees you are measuring the design intent (e.g., exactly 120.00mm) effectively ignoring print artifacts.
